# Text in Ladino (corpus)

When learning a language it is important to read a lot.

Here you'll find Ladino texts for reading.

* You can take a look at the [Ladino version of the wikipedia](https://lad.wikipedia.org/) There are not many pages and most of them are rather short,
but it can be interesting to read. Unfortunately some of the pages were written with Modern Spanish words and not Ladino. There is some effort to review
the articles and improve them.

* [Songs in Ladino](ladino-music) if they come with their lyrics can be a nice source of reading material.

* [Books](books-in-ladino) and newspapers written in Ladino

* The [Ladinokomunita](https://ladinokomunita.groups.io/) email list has some good correspondence in Ladino and the various [Facebook groups](ladino-on-facebook) also contain text.
